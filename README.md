# Advent of Code 2021

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: Solved 1st day, had a little hiccup with making GET requests in Rust but ironed it out. Turns out Rust core is well documented but community packages often are not 😞
### Update #3: Today I complicated this really easy day 4 challenge. We were making homemade sausages and other meat products so was kinda on and off across the day. Need to find JavaScript `some` and `every` alternatives in Rust.
### Update #4: First AOC weekend done ✔️, as usual weekend puzzles tend to be more tricky. Learned some stuff and also day 5 got me through the first grid based puzzle in Rust. HashMaps to the rescue and let's move on!!!
### Update #5: Pretty hard day for me even though the problem in the end was not that complicated. Started with solution similar to the final one but then tried to be "smart" and deduce non brute force solution. After few hours of pen and paper, cooked wine, beers 🍻 and billiard I moved to initial brute force idea... another few hours later it is 02:36 AM and I am done 🎊 .. I guess my concentration was not the best 😝 bring it AOC!
