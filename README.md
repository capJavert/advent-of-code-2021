# Advent of Code 2021

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: Solved 1st day, had a little hiccup with making GET requests in Rust but ironed it out. Turns out Rust core is well documented but community packages often are not 😞
### Update #3: Today I complicated this really easy day 4 challenge. We were making homemade sausages and other meat products so was kinda on and off across the day. Need to find JavaScript `some` and `every` alternatives in Rust.
