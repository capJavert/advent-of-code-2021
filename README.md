# Advent of Code 2021

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: Solved 1st day, had a little hiccup with making GET requests in Rust but ironed it out. Turns out Rust core is well documented but community packages often are not 😞
### Update #3: Today I complicated this really easy day 4 challenge. We were making homemade sausages and other meat products so was kinda on and off across the day. Need to find JavaScript `some` and `every` alternatives in Rust.
### Update #4: First AOC weekend done ✔️, as usual weekend puzzles tend to be more tricky. Learned some stuff and also day 5 got me through the first grid based puzzle in Rust. HashMaps to the rescue and let's move on!!!
### Update #5: Pretty hard day for me even though the problem in the end was not that complicated. Started with solution similar to the final one but then tried to be "smart" and deduce non brute force solution. After few hours of pen and paper, cooked wine, beers 🍻 and billiard I moved to initial brute force idea... another few hours later it is 02:36 AM and I am done 🎊 .. I guess my concentration was not the best 😝 bring it AOC!
### Update #6: Second AOC weekend done ✔️ .. cool puzzles but hopefully I am getting into grip with Rust enough to be better in implementing my solutions, also this marks half mark for the AOC 2021, let's move on!!!
### Update #7: Third AOC weekend (kinda) done.. some really hard puzzles last week and was also traveling during the weekend (also we went looking for the 🎄). Day 16 was hard to wrap my head around because of the recursions in part 2 but managed to backtrack it today. Day 18 was also recursions but after some tinkering I solved it with more straightforward stack based solution. Missing day 20 so far.. will try to backtrack it during this final week until Xmas 🤞
### Update #8: Backtracked day 19.. shout-out to [this solution](https://github.com/joeyemerson/aoc/blob/main/2021/19-beacon-scanner/solution.js) for helping me understand the basic logic. Note, those 3d rotations are hard.. final week, let's move on!!!
### Update #9: Day 21 featured a really cool board game.. solved part 1 quickly but part 2 to involved parallel universes so I pulled from this [parallel repo for hint..](https://github.com/Lacuno/aoc-2021/blob/master/aoc21.js#L75-L84) 😆
### Update #10: Day 22.. Visualization is the king!! 👑
### Update #11: Day 23.. Made a terminal game to solve both parts by hand.. took some time but it was really fun to code.. also checked out some rust based terminal/text helper cargos.
